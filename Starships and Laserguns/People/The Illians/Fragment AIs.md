The Fragment AIs were [[Artificial Intelligence]]s created specifically by the [[United Terran Governance]] with permission from the [[AI council]] in the year [[2532 TMY]]. These AIs were created with the express purpose of being assistants to [[The Illians]]. They have lessened senses of independence and are extremely loyal to their assigned Illian.
