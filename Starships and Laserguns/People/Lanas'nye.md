Sister of [[Laras'nye]], Lanas'nye was an [[Extended]] [[Du'Lak]] woman born on [[Twill]].
She died on the planet [[Draco]] at the hands of ancient [[Dracon]]s during an observation mission. This event caused significant friction as [[Laras'nye]] blocked the [[Dracon]]s from joining [[The Alliance]] as she did not forgive them for Lanas'nye's death.
