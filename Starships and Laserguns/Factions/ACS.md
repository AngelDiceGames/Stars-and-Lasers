The ACS (Alliance Cartographic Society) is a mapping and exploration guild within [[The Alliance]]. It was initially set up by [[5 - Unknown Unknown]], and continues to be funded by them to this day.

#### Levels
The ACS has a level based structure of staff and contractors with each level having special permissions and requirements.

* Level 1 - This level is for staff only, and is reserved for the people who run the back-end of the ACS's systems. This includes the logistics and personnel divisions as well as the system admins that maintain the ACS's galactic map.
* Level 2 - This level is for the crew on ACS ships. These positions are generally technically contractors. Level 2's do not have access to the ACS's galactic database.
* Level 3 - This level is for the captains of ACS exploration ships with one or no crew members. This level is also given for 1st officers serving on ships under a Level 4 captain.
* Level 4 - This level is for captains of ACS exploration ships with two or more crew members. When a Level 3 captain of a ship hires on their second crew member they may upgrade to Level 4.
* Level 5 - This level is reserved for the admirals of Exploration fleets. This level is particularly uncommon as Exploration fleets are generally rare.

#### The Map
The ACS maintain a single huge database. This is decentralised and copies are spread across their various locations across the galaxy. Updates to the database, often known as the Gal-Map, are synced daily.
