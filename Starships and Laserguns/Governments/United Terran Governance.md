The original governing body of the [[Races/Terran]]s and later the [[Artificial Intelligence]], when they first left their homeworld of [[Terra Maxima]].

The UTG was formed during the Unification War of 2107 TMY, and survived until the formation of [[the Alliance]]. 

Originally, the UTG was a democratic government, that prided itself on fair and free representation of their people. However, during the year 2355 the UTG suffered a military coup which lead to the UTG becoming a military dictatorship for the rest of its years.
