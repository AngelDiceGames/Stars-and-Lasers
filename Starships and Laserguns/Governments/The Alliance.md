The Alliance is a nation state that covers the majority of [[Omnia]].

### History
##### Formation
Formed in [[2493 TMY]] the Alliance was created to solidify the end of [[The First Stellar War]]. The Alliance was created first as a literal Alliance between the [[United Terran Governance]] and the [[Royal Twill Queendom]]. 
Over the course of the 20 to 30 years the Alliance between the two stellar nations evolved into a singular nation state in and of itself.
This alliance was formed in the aftermath of [[The First Stellar War]] as an attempt to prevent another full scale interstellar war from ever occurring again. Both the [[Terran]]s and [[Du'Lak]] had a long history of total warfare, but this war was so devastating that both sides agreed that such a thing must be prevented at all costs in the future.

##### Growth
The Alliance expanded Quickly throughout Omnia, making use of the Ringworld's Gateways to quickly expand throughout the Omnia's Alpha Arm, Core, and then Beta Arm.

During this expansion effort, the Alliance encountered the [[Draconis]] star system in the year [[1,373 ARD]]. They found the primitive [[Dracon]]s on the world of [[Draco]], and set up a number of observation posts and remote observation satellites. 
The Alliance withdrew all of their surface presence from [[Draco]] in [[1,389 ARD]] when one of their observation stations were attacked by primitive Dracon hunters who had discovered it. Despite taking relatively heavy losses to the advanced weaponry of the Alliance, they killed the entire scientific team, notably including [[Lanas'nye]].

In the year [[2,239 ARD]] the Alliance encountered the system of [[Nu'VaeLaa]], where they made contact with the struggling [[LaeKieDa']]. The [[LaeKieDa']] officially joined the Alliance in the year [[2,243 ARD]]. 

In the year [[3,426 ARD]] an observation satellite in orbit of [[Draco]] was damaged by a micro meteorite. Within the year, the [[Dracon]]s had sent up an early space-flight mission to capture the satellite. They reverse engineered it, and using the communication protocols on the satellite made first contact with the Alliance in [[3,698 ARD]].

Supreme Fleet Admiral Laras'nye prevented the Dracons from joining the Alliance for nearly 300 years as she held a grudge over the death of her sister Lanas'nye. However, eventually she was overruled and the Dracons joined the Alliance in [[3,704 ARD]].

The Alliance encountered the world of [[Fraya (Planet)]] in the [[Fraya (Star system)]] system, in the year [[3,926 ARD]]. Here they met the [[Frayan]]s, and made first contact. The Frayans were not eager to give up their independence and refused to join the Alliance, but established peaceful, if limited, relations.

In the year [[4,288 ARD]] The [[Vythrinv]] appeared on the edge of Alliance controlled space, claiming to already be members. Despite the slightly strange circumstances surrounding their joining of the alliance, they integrated quickly into Alliance culture.

The [[Frayan]]s finally joined the Alliance on the 400th anniversary of first contact, in [[4,326 ARD]], despite having effectively integrated for some time before then.

In [[4,673 ARD]] the Alliance first encountered the Techni, a mechanical menace which seemed to start springing up on a number of their fringe worlds. The Alliance was able to easily dispatch of the Techni that appeared and they became seen more as a dangerous part of the eco-system of systems that were being settled than a real threat. This attitude would last for a few thousand years but as they grew in strength and their true numbers were revealed to the galaxy as a whole this attitude changed.

In [[5,135 ARD]] the Alliance traced signals to the [[Ank'urn]] system, where they found the [[Ra'avnii]]. The alliance made contact with the [[Ra'avnii]]'s government and they officially joined in [[5,194 ARD]].

Nearly 3,000 years later in [[7,115 ARD]] an [[ACS]] starship traced signals in the void to the [[Corr'ak]] system. Here, the Alliance officially made first contact with the [[Ennuan]]. As the [[Corr'ak]] system was in the midst of a civil war, The Alliance occupied the system until the year [[7,193 ARD]], when the Treaty of [[Raan'ilo]] was signed. The Ra'avnii eventually joined the Alliance in [[7,234 ARD]].

Under 300 years later, in [[7,515 ARD]] the Alliance was attacked by the [[Children of Cylax]]. The Alliance, being over 7,000 years more technologically advanced, and far larger easily crushed the Zangen's empire in the ensuing war, and the Zangen were forced to surrender when the Alliance occupied Cylax in [[7,519 ARD]]. When the Zangen capitulated, they were forced to join the Alliance, a particularly unpopular move on both sides, but one backed by all nine of [[The Illians]], who still remembered the original purpose of the Alliance.

In [[8,532 ARD]] an [[ACS]] pilot encountered a massive fleet of ancient starships slowly warping at slower-than-light speeds through the void between stars. This fleet was the [[Drachnie]] nomad fleet that had been slowly travelling between stars for over 17,000 years. The fleet were perfectly content to maintain their lifestyle, and although they engaged in some trade with the alliance over the following years

In the year [[10,256 ARD]] the Alliance discovered a race calling themselves the [[Kelkex]]. The [[Kelkex]] were in the process of launching themselves into orbit via a system of magnetic acceleration rails at the time.

The Alliance has always had issues expanding in certain regions, but an area of space known as the [[Dead Zone]] seemed to be rife with missing colonies and ships that never reached their destination. In [[10,345 ARD]] the Alliance first discovered why this was. 
The Xavaan, claimed this region of space as their own, and aggressively defended it against any incursions by the Alliance. Once the Alliance became aware of them, but it became clear the Xavaan were a hivemind with no interest in cooperation, they mostly avoided the [[Dead Zone]].

##### Modern Day
Modern Day is considered to be the year [[10,560 ARD]]. The Alliance as it stands is comprised of 9 races; the [[Terran]]s (both biological Terrans and the [[Artificial Intelligence]]), the [[Du'Lak]], the [[Dracon]]s, the [[Frayan]]s, the [[LaeKieDa']], the [[Ennuan]], the [[Zangen]], the [[Vythrinv]], and the [[Ra'avnii]].
Alliance space also contains some [[Ship Spirits]], [[Drachnie]], and [[Kelkex]] but the former are not recognised and the latter two generally don't hold citizenship, although it is possible.
