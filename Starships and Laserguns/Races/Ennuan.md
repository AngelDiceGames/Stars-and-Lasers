#### Appearance
The Ennuan are a humanoid avian race that are from the world of [[Corr'an]] in the [[Corr'ak]] system. The Ennuan are roughly humanoid, though their arms are winged and they sport a long feathered tail and extra set of winged arms. The Ennuan's arms are segmented into three sections; the upper and middle arms are similar in structure to that of other humanoid races, however between the middle and lower arm sections is the hand. The Lower arm section is used solely for supporting the wing and folds the opposite direction to the elbow. It is also significantly weaker, similar in strength to two fingers.

The Ennuan's hand is comprised of three fingers and two thumbs. They also have an upper and lower wrist. The lower wrist is where the lower arm attaches and is far smaller than the upper wrist which attaches to the larger middle arm. Each of the arm sections are similar in length. When held at their side, the Ennuan's hands will be about half way between their waist and knees, making their arms sections similarly proportioned to that of Terrans, but overall about a half as long again.

The Ennuan's lower wings are attached just above the hips and are much smaller. They are about half the size and do not have a hand. Instead they have a single claw that is often used for climbing in combination with their legs. This claw is attached to a single joint that can be locked in position when fully curled inward to allow the Ennuan to hang from these wings passively. The Ennuan's lower wings are also capable of rotating a full 270 degrees either way in their sockets, allowing them to be used to cling to rock faces while fully inverted without any discomfort.

The Ennuan's faces are similar to [[Races/Terran]]s, though their features are sharper and their eyes more slanted. Their eyes glow faintly in the dark and come in shades of red, yellow and green. Similar to the [[Du'Lak]], the Ennuan have naturally excellent vision.

The Ennuan have long winglike ears that are covered in a soft fur that helps insulate them from the wind. These are often pierced numerous times. Additionally, they have an odd number of teeth in their top jaw, giving them a single middle tooth which forms a large fang in the centre. They also have two smaller fangs on their lower jaws and their teeth usually interlock perfectly when their mouths are closed.

As for reproductive organs, the Ennuan males have spring loaded retractable penises as such appendages would prove to be an irritant during flight. Similarly, the females, whilst still mammals, have particularly flat breasts that significantly increase in size during pregnancy until they are more in line with those of other humanoid species. These will slowly revert over the course of the half year after childbirth. By this time the children should be able to be sustained on solid food.

Speaking of children, the Ennuan usually learn to fly at a similar pace to walking. There is not much flat land on their home world and thus they must both walk and fly to traverse it naturally so both skills are learnt at the same time.

The Ennuan do grow hair on their heads (nowhere else), however, they are incapable of growing facial hair. On rare occasion, some (1 in 3) males of the species are able to grow beards, however these beards are comprised of short feathers.

#### History
The Ennuan developed technology slowly. They come from a world that has an atmosphere many times denser than any Alliance race can withstand, and are thus confined to a small band of pressure that is roughly equivalent to that of [[Terra Maxima]].

The Ennuan's home world of [[Corr'an]] is covered in mountainous spires that reach out of the depths of the overwhelming pressure and into the habitable zone of the planet. This is where the Ennuan live. This has led their society to develop slowly, due to the extremely limited inhabitable area.

The Ennuan developed bridge-cities that span between the chasms of the mountainous spires. The first bridge-towns began to appear in around the year [[3200 ARD]]. These bridge-towns remained fairly consistent in size and rarely did their inhabitants tend to stray far from them, much like with any medieval period. They farmed the plant life that grew on the cliff sides and small birds that fed upon them.

In the year [[4562 ARD]] construction on the first bridge-city was finished. Until then, Ennuan society had always been dominated by the bridge-towns. Each bridge was a self governing body and they had no governing structure between bridges outside of trade agreements.
Because a bridge's survival was only as assured as it's size allowed, the first bridge-city was constructed by a group of smaller bridge-towns banding together to create a larger force.
The first bridge-city was called [[Corr'an]]. The size and combined resources of the [[Corr'an]] and the smaller villages that had worked together to create [[Corr'an]] lead to the bridge-city's dominance over a large swath of the world. With each new bridge-town brought into the fold, [[Corr'an]] became more powerful and swiftly moved on to consume other bridges.
Eventually other Bridge-cities were constructed alongside [[Corr'an]], though they always lay in the shadow of [[Corr'an]]'s might.

In the year [[6543 ARD]] the Ennuan launched their first rocket beyond the edge of the atmosphere. Although that first flight ended in disaster they were not dissuaded, and by the end of the decade had managed to put their first person in space and were developing a budding space program.

The space program marked the end of the Ennuan's slow technological development, and by the end of the century they had a number of space stations with continual habitation.
The Ennuans developed their first photon drive in the year [[6683 ARD]] and put it into use the next year. This leap forward in technology brought the Ennuan into the stars, and they began to explore the rest of their star system, which they named [[Corr'ak]].

The [[Corr'ak]] system would be forever changed in the year [[7013 ARD]]. Conflict broke out between the budding factions of the Ennuan. The core world of [[Corr'an]] went to war with the colonies spread throughout the rest of the system.

The Ennuan's first true war was devastating to both sides, millions of lives were lost in fleet engagements as well as strikes against civilian targets. They had no laws of war, and played to no rules. Terrible acts were committed on both sides which would later be declared war-crimes.

#### First Contact
The Ennuan's war was cut short in the year [[7115 ARD]]. Seemingly the war would've lasted until one or both sides were extinct. However, in that year a small [[ACS]] ship detected anomalous readings coming from a nearby star while deep in unknown space.
The war was stopped when a one man starship seemingly appeared in the middle of their star system in a brilliant flash of light.
The Lone pilot of that starship was an ex-military [[Du'Lak]] by the name [[Raan'ilo]]. He recognised the war he had jumped into the middle of, and that if he did not act quickly, these people would wipe themselves out. He made contact with the leaders of both factions and within two days had both the Ennuan high council of [[Corr'an]] and the lords of the outer worlds at the table. He threatened them both with Alliance intervention, and forced the two sides to agree to a ceasefire. As no true leadership could be agreed upon within the three days that [[Raan'ilo]] spent negotiating with the Ennuan, he made his way back to [[the Alliance]], and brought back a proper military intervention.
The treaty of Raan'ilo was signed later that year, bringing an official ceasefire to the Ennuan war, as well as their unconditional surrender to [[the alliance]]. [[The Alliance]] dethroned the lords of the outer lords and dismantled the high council. In it's place it produced the first democracy that the Ennuan people had ever known.
[[The Alliance]] pulled out of the [[Corr'ak]] system in the year [[7193 ARD]], but were not gone long as the Ennuan opened trade relations only 2 years later and officially joined the Alliance in the year [[7234 ARD]].
