#### Appearance
The Ra'avnii are a humanoid race that joined [[the alliance]] early in it's 6th millennium. The Ra'avnii are completely blind, having never evolved eyes. The Ra'avnii have instead, two pair of ears that they have developed for extreme precision in hearing, and an incredibly acute tactile sense. While one part of their split-tails or either of their feet is in contact with the ground, the Ra'avnii are able to sense minute vibrations that they can use to effectively see around them.

Although they wouldn't know it for many years, the Ra'avnii are visually distinct. They have a bright red, blue, or in rare cases, white skin. Their humanoid faces have no eyes or eye sockets, instead their cheeks blend smoothly into their brow. From their upper brow, a pair of large horns grow. These horns take on the same colour as the Ra'avnii's skin, and curl back. The Ra'avnii have two pairs of pointed ears on the sides of their heads with the higher of the two pairs being larger. The Ra'avnii have a long tail that continues from the end of their spine. Half way along this tail, it splits into two laterally. After the split in the tail, the shape of the internal and external structures are as though a single tail had been actively split. Practically, this means that the tail takes on a “D” shaped cross section. Additionally, the tail is tipped with a spade shaped, heart shaped or diamond shaped pad, split between the two halves of the split tail.

Ra'avnii have two distinct sub-species. They are the [[Greater Ra'avnii]] and [[Lesser Ra'avnii]]. These two have never heard ear-to-ear, as the saying goes. 
The [[Greater Ra'avnii]] stand about 2.0 to 2.5 meters in height and have only a single pair of horns. Although in the modern day it is of little relevance, historically the [[greater Ra'avnii]] have always been of a more calm temperament. The [[Greater Ra'avnii]] are slimmer than their shorter counterparts and generally have less muscle mass overall.

The [[lesser Ra'avnii]] stand around 1.5 to 2.0 meters in height and sport a secondary set of small horns. These Ra'avnii have a more stocky build. They have increased muscle mass but have historically been aggressive and abrasive.

#### History
The two Ra'avnii formed separate cultures that regularly interacted. The [[Greater Ra'avnii]] formed a generally peaceful matriarchal culture that valued fine arts as well as incorporating and supporting nature. Meanwhile, the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] formed highly meritocratic honour bound clans. These clans warred over the smallest of offences for generations as the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]]'s industrial complex saw them carving entire mountain ranges into city kingdoms of incredible scale. Even the most bitter [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] clans would work frictionlessly together towards a shared goal. As such, early in their history, the Lesser Ra'avnii clans banded together in an attempt to find a way to avoid more wars. Unable to appoint a leader from among their own ranks, the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] turned to the [[Greater Ra'avnii]] for aid. The [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] appointed a neutral [[Greater Ra'avnii]] as king. One who's word was law, and one who would remain impartial to all of the clans. 
For many years, the [[Greater Ra'avnii]] guided the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] as they developed. However, as the years went onward and the king demanded more work under the guise of keeping peace, the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] slowly become little more than slaves in their own cities to their Greater counterparts.

This regime would unfortunately hold the Ra'avnii back, as even while [[the Alliance]] was being forged, and other races took to the stars the Ra'avnii were complacent on their home-world. 

This would change however, some time in the Alliance's mid fourth millennium, when the Ra'avnii would first be capable of reaching for the stars. Without their knowledge, the Ra'avnii's skyline had held a secret from the blind race. The Ra'avnii had developed a device capable of converting light into a tactile sensation that could be felt by a Ra'avnii's sensitive hands. With this device they discovered that there was more to the universe than their lone world, which they had named [[Atu'urn]].

[[Atu'urn]], as the Ra'avnii soon discovered was moon to a much larger world that they endeavoured to reach. The Ra'avnii named the world they orbited [[Ank'traa]], and set about manufacturing a means of reaching the skies. The Ra'avnii societies turned their combined might towards reaching [[Ank'traa]], and after only one hundred years, they achieved their goal. They soon found that the greater gravity of [[Ank'traa]] was distinctly unsuitable for the [[Greater Ra'avnii]], but their smaller counterparts were more than capable of withstanding it.
[[Ank'traa]]'s lush and untouched landscape was swiftly industrialised by the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] clans, who were instructed to mine resources for their homeworld.

Eventually, the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] were all moved to [[Ank'traa]], while the [[Greater Ra'avnii]] maintained their supremacy from [[Atu'urn]].

It would take nearly 500 standard years for this to change. The [[Ank'traa]] Ra'avnii population, who finally grew more tired of their exploitation than loyal to their honour pacts of a millennium long past, revolted. 

They cut supplies for [[Atu'urn]] and began to starve out the [[Greater Ra'avnii]], whilst bunkering themselves down as the once beautiful [[Ank'traa]] was turned to a wasteland by weapons fire from the [[Greater Ra'avnii]] who attempted to beat the [[Lesser Ra'avnii]] into submission.
The [[lesser Ra'avnii]] survived however, and after a decade of warfare between the two worlds, the [[Ank'traa]] and [[Atu'urn]] Ra'avnii eventually came to a peaceful resolution at the hands of the first half-and-half Ra'avnii to be born for over two thousand years. This peace was uneasy at first, but as the next four generations came and went it slowly became more solid.

In the year [[5135 ARD]], [[the Alliance]] made first contact with the Ra'avnii, who had been sending Radio signals into deep space for years in hopes of finding other life outside of their own system. The Ra'avnii were greeted with open arms and in the year [[5194 ARD]] they joined [[the Alliance]] and began spreading across the stars.
In the more than 5,300 years since their induction into [[the alliance]] the Ra'avnii's atrocities against their own people have not been forgotten.
