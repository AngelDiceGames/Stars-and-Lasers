Extension is an incredibly rare gift, exclusively given by [[The Illians]]. Each Illian, was capable of extending only 10 other individuals, although they were later capable of taking that gift away and giving it to another person later on, should they chose.

When an Extended character dies, [[The Illians]] only have a few hours to reclaim the gift of extension from the dead extended. If they fail to do so, the gift is lost forever.

Extension is temporarily suppressible with a medicine that the one of the Extended developed in [[5,763 ARD]]. This is something that they must do if they want to have children as the child cannot develop if they can't age. Once born the child must also take the medicine daily as they're growing or they won't age that day.

If an extended has a child, that child will be naturally Extended. [[The Illians]] can't take a Naturally Extended's gift away from them, including if they die.

The Extended have significant difficulties with childbirth, and even with all the advantages of modern medicine they have a less than 15% chance of having a successful child. This is compounded by the Extended being significantly less fertile due to their gift.

What this means in essence is that the Extended are incredibly rare, and the Naturally Extended now out-number them.

In modern Alliance society, the Extended form a sort of Noble class among the near-Nobility that exists at the upper echelon of the galaxy's elite.
